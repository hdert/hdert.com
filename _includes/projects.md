[Power Comparison](https://github.com/hdert/power-comparison). Power Comparison is a modern Tkinter-based app for comparing power plans, and viewing your power usage. It is [published on](https://pypi.org/project/power-comparison/) PyPI.

It is intended to be used in the Christchurch area (because that is where the current hard-coded dataset comes from). It is also intended to be used by a household that has a plan with Contact, as it uses their API to download your usage data.

Unfortunately most power providers in New Zealand (including Contact) do not have open APIs that you can use to download your usage data. The current alternative is to email your provider asking for your usage data, which is a very manual process.

[Soil Moisture Probe](https://github.com/Lambosaurus/JM-SoilProbe-FW). With the help of [Tim Lamborn](https://github.com/Lambosaurus) I assembled some pre-designed soil moisture probes. Using this [STM32X HAL Library](https://github.com/Lambosaurus/STM32X), I programmed them in C.

[Cloudflare WagDNS](https://github.com/hdert/cf-wagdns). A DNS record updater program written in Rust with the ability to update Cloudflare Zero Trust Access Group Rules.

I made this because there was a lack of software that could update both DNS records and Zero Trust rules at once, which was something that I required for my home-lab setup. I decided to use Rust to do it since I wanted to improve on my skills in the language.
