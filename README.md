### [Soil Moisture Probe](https://github.com/Lambosaurus/JM-SoilProbe-FW)

With the help of [Tim Lamborn](https://github.com/Lambosaurus) I assembled some pre-designed soil moisture probes. Using this [STM32X HAL Library](https://github.com/Lambosaurus/STM32X), I programmed them in C.

### [Cloudflare WagDNS](https://github.com/hdert/cf-wagdns)

A DNS record updater program written in Rust with the ability to update Cloudflare Zero Trust Access Group Rules.

I made this because there was a lack of software that could update both DNS records and Zero Trust rules at once, which was something that I required for my home-lab setup. I decided to use Rust to do it since I wanted to improve on my skills in the language.
